# osmi_mental_health
A web app developed to predict whether or not an individual is likely to bring up mental health concerns with a potential employer.

The requirements.txt features all of the packages necessary to run the app via Streamlit sharing.

The Tuned_XXXXX pickle files are the tuned and saved models that are loaded within the app to generate predictions. These pipelines were generated using PyCaret.
